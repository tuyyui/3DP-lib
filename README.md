# RayCast-Library
Ray-tracer library in C++.

# Dependencies

* STL

# Follow-along

In this project I'm following this pdf book https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf to build it out while adding my own custom code that's scales and is faster.

# Compiling

Compliations are done in the test.cc file. 

# Output files

Files will be outputted through a *ppm* file.
